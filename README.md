# Server Resource Monitoring and Alert System

This PowerShell script monitors system resource usage, including CPU, memory, RAM, and network connectivity. It is designed to run automatically every 15 minutes via Task Scheduler, logging each execution for tracking purposes. Additionally, the script includes an email alert mechanism that notifies users when CPU usage exceeds a defined threshold.


## Features

‚úÖ Resource Monitoring: Tracks CPU, memory, RAM usage, and network connectivity.

üìú Logging: Maintains logs of every execution for easy tracking.

üìß Email Alerts: Sends notifications using Mailersend's test SMTP when CPU usage crosses a threshold.

üîí Secure Credentials: Uses CLIXML encryption for storing SMTP credentials.

‚è≥ Scheduled Execution: Runs automatically every 15 minutes via Windows Task Scheduler.
